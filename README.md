# Intentionally Inaccessible Infinite Scroll Feed

This web page was created using fake API data from JSONPlaceholder and Faker, logos from Logoipsum and UI structures from shadcn.

It resembles a landing page consisting of five differently designed zones, four of which processes data from these respective APIs.

For faster data access, the data is stored in SessionStorage after initial loading to reduce waiting times when reloading.

The highlight of this page is the infinite scroll feed, which automatically loads and displays new posts when the end of the page is reached by scrolling. The API provides a total of 500 posts. After that, the end of the page is reached.

This site is a rebuild of the [Infinite Scroll Feed Repository](https://github.com/StackOverflowIsBetterThanAnyAI/infinite-scroll-feed) with the only difference being that it intentionally violates accessibility as often as possible.
